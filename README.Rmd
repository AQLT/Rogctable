# Rogctable

Uses packages `ocg-p`, `datatool`, `tikz` and `booktabs` to create sortable table with LaTeX output.
Build on PDF Layers (Optional Content Groups (OCG)): only works with Acrobat Reader, Foxit Reader, PDF-XChange-Viewer or Evince.

## Usage

You must import the package `ocg-p`, `datatool`, `tikz`, `booktabs` and `colortbl`, for example using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
header-includes:
   - \usepackage{ocg-p,datatool,tikz,booktabs,colortbl}
```

The `results='asis'` must be used in the chunks.
Then you just need to use the function `ogc_table` with `cat`:

````md
```{r data, result = 'asis'}`r ''`
library(Rogctable)
x = data.frame(`First name` = c("Paul","John","Ever","Werner","Peggy"),
               `Last name` = c("Bauer", "Doe", "Last", "Moshammer", "Sue"),
               `Grade` = c(1,5,4,1,3),
               check.names = FALSE)
cat(ogc_table(x),
    sep = "\n")
```
````

In the current version of `Rogctable`, only ascending sort is available and in the first layer (the one visible if you use a software non-compatible with OCG-layer) the data is sort by the first column.
